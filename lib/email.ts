 * async function that throws on delivery failure. Every existing caller
 * (approval, auth, finance, meeting, member, transactions, specialWishes)
 * keeps working untouched.
 *
 * Internally the transport is now resolved from the active MailSettings row in
 * the DB (see lib/mail/providers.ts). When no provider is configured yet — or
 * the row is disabled / missing required secrets — we fall back to the legacy
 * env-based Gmail transporter so the app keeps sending on first deploy.
